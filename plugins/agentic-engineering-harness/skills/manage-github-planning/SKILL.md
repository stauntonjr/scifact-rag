# Manage GitHub planning

Treat `.github/planning.json` as desired topology, Issues as canonical work objects, and the live Project as the operational view.

## Required sequence

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `harness/project.yaml`, `.github/planning.json`, and relevant Issues.
2. Inspect repository identity and authentication without exposing credentials.
3. Validate local desired state with `python3 tools/github_planning.py audit --offline`.
4. For a new repository, preview Project creation or canonical-Project copying with `python3 tools/github_planning.py bootstrap-project`. Use `--yes` only after authorization.
5. Read live state with `python3 tools/github_planning.py audit`; this includes the selected Project title, fields, basic saved views, and repository link.
6. Preview the smallest label and milestone reconciliation with `python3 tools/github_planning.py apply`.
7. Explain every proposed write and obtain authorization.
8. Apply only with `--yes`. Re-audit live state afterward.

Read `references/safety.md` before live writes.

## Projects v2 work-item membership

Do not pass `--project` to `gh issue create` or `gh pr create`. That shortcut resolves deprecated
Projects (classic), not the configured Projects v2 roadmap.

Use this sequence instead:

1. Create the Issue or pull request without `--project` and capture its exact URL.
2. Preview `python3 tools/github_planning.py add-item --url URL`.
3. Explain the Project v2 membership write and obtain authorization.
4. Run `python3 tools/github_planning.py add-item --url URL --yes`.
5. Re-read the Project items and the work item's `projectItems` membership.

The wrapper pre-reads membership, returns without a write when one exact item already exists,
rejects duplicates, uses `gh project item-add` only when absent, and refuses success until one exact
URL match with a valid Project item ID is returned. If any step fails, inspect whether the work
item was created before retrying and record a reusable correction in
`docs/project/correction-log.md`.

## Work-item rules

- Search for duplicates before creating an Issue.
- Give every Issue observable acceptance criteria, one primary milestone, and one primary Project ownership lane.
- Use dependencies instead of duplicating work across Projects.
- Move work to Done only when acceptance evidence is complete on the integration branch.
- Use `Closes #N` only for a fully complete Issue; otherwise use `Part of #N`.

## Completion

Report exact object names, URLs or IDs when available, counts, writes performed, and residual drift. A successful command exit is not sufficient; re-read the changed objects.

The tool can create or copy a Project, link it to the repository, add an existing Issue or pull
request to Projects v2, and create missing fields and basic saved views. It creates or updates
labels and milestones separately. Existing field/view mismatches and complex view layout settings
remain manual because replacing them could destroy values or human layout intent. Read
`docs/project/github-planning.md` for the shared-versus-dedicated decision and exact boundary.
